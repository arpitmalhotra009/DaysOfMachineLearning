# DaysOfMachineLearning
In this repository, very simple projects have been posted. The projects are related to building the concepts related to Machine Learning. I have started this repository to keep the track of how I am understanding the algorithms related to Machine Learning.

## [First Project: Univariate Regression from Scratch](https://github.com/arpitmalhotra009/DaysOfMachineLearning/blob/master/Univariate%20Linear%20Regression%20from%20Scratch/Predicting_Profit.ipynb)

In this project, I have build the Linear Regression Model from Scratch, which means, basic function like ***Cost Function, Gradient Calculation and Update, Gradient Descent Algorithm*** are written and ***no high level libraries related to Machine Learning like scikit-Learn or Statsmodels*** have been used.

The Dataset is related to Bike Sharing in which the Independent Variable is Population of the town and the Dependent/ Target Variable is Profit.

This project could be useful to a person who is starting the journey of Learning Machine Learning as very basic Programming has been used and useful concepts have been explained.
The Projects follows **CRISP-DM** approach that is used in almost all Data Science and ML Industries

## [Second Project: Logistic Regression from Scratch](https://github.com/arpitmalhotra009/DaysOfMachineLearning/blob/master/Logistic%20regression%20from%20scratch/License_Prediction.ipynb)

In this project, I have build the Logistic Regression Model from Scratch, which means, basic function like ***Cost Function, Gradient Calculation and Update, Gradient Descent Algorithm*** are written and ***no high level libraries related to Machine Learning like scikit-Learn or Statsmodels*** have been used.

The Dataset is related to Motor vehicle Test in which the Independent Variable are the scores of two DMV Test and the Dependent/ Target Variable is whether the person will be given the Drivers Licence or not.\

## [Third Project: K-Nearest Neighbour from Scratch](https://github.com/arpitmalhotra009/DaysOfMachineLearning/blob/master/K-NN%20Regression%20From%20Scratch/KNN_from_Scratch.ipynb)

In this project, I have build the K-NN Regression Model from Scratch, which means, basic function like ***Cost Function, Gradient Calculation and Update, Gradient Descent Algorithm*** are written and ***no high level libraries related to Machine Learning like scikit-Learn*** have been used.

The Scikit Learn Library is used to generate a dummy dataset on which KNN Regression is applied. This project has many useful concepts for a newbee in the field of Machine Learning.

## [Fourth Project: Image Compression Using K-Means Clustering and PCA](https://github.com/arpitmalhotra009/DaysOfMachineLearning/blob/master/Image%20Compression%20using%20K_Means-and-PCA/Image%20Compression%20Using%20K_Means%20Algorithm%20and%20PCA.ipynb)

In project is related to a very interesting application of K-Means Clustering. In the project on can see how K-Means Clustering can help in Dimensionality reduction and the results are compared with a very popular Dimensionality reduction Technique Principle Component Analysis.
